Hello everyone!

Here is the example of adding a functionality of streaming a video using libstreaming (https://github.com/fyhertz/libstreaming).
The main project of ics-openvpn belongs to schwabe (https://github.com/schwabe) and can be found at https://github.com/schwabe/ics-openvpn.

If you have any questions, feel free to contact me at vkjohn96@gmail.com.
P.S. The main project of using libstreaming, which is integrated here, can be found at https://github.com/korinel96/OnAir_0.4
